The aim is to develop a system that allows users to control games using natural body movements, enhancing the gaming experience. Key components include the use of Python, NumPy, PyGame, MediaPipe, and OpenCV libraries for motion detection and real-time interaction. The project addresses the design and implementation of a motion detection system, user interface customization, and accessibility considerations. The proposed methodology involves using webcams for gesture detection, preprocessing with MediaPipe, and employing machine learning models to interpret gestures and translate them into in-game actions. The document outlines steps for implementation, user testing, and evaluating the impact of motion detection on gaming immersion and accessibility, ultimately aiming to create a more engaging and physically interactive gaming experience.
